# Theory
## Learning materials
### Online courses
- [Coursera, Machine learning specialization, University of Washington](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning) This the most basic course. It covers all the basics and has a few programming tasks. Math knowledge needed is covered in the course materials. Technology: Jupyter / IPython. 
- [Coursera, Andrew Ng, Machine learining, Stanford University](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) This course is recommended for all beginners. It skims over math except for matrix operations which are covered in the course materials. There are some programming assignments, but rather an afterthought. Technology: Octave, If you want to go deeper, try [Andrew Ng's Stanford lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzxYlbK2c7E&list=PLJ_CMbwA6bT-n1W0mgOlYwccZ-j6gBXqE)
